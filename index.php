Introduction
Now that you have explored what Windows 7 has to offer, we can help you understand what's involved in moving to this operating system.

In this lesson, we will review the various versions of Windows 7 and the system requirements for running the operating system. We will discuss the process of upgrading and any considerations you need to be aware of before switching to Windows 7.

Note: Windows 10 was released in July 2015. Since it uses the same system requirements as Windows 7, you might consider upgrading to Windows 10 instead. Visit our Windows 10 tutorial to learn more.

Windows 7 versions and pricing
The major upgrade versions of Windows 7 are Home Premium, Professional, and Ultimate. Home Premium is the most popular version of Windows 7 and will likely suit the needs of most users. The Professional version may appeal to owners of small to medium-sized businesses because it has extras like Windows XP mode and networking backup features. Ultimate is the most powerful version, with added security features like Bitlocker and the flexibility of use in 35 languages.

Windows 7 Desktop
You may come across a Windows 7 Starter version. This version is made for smaller laptops (sometimes called netbooks) and will have limited performance and features compared to Home Premium.
There is also a Windows 7 Home Premium Family Pack ($149.99) for upgrading up to three PCs in a home.
Full versions of the above products are more expensive but will only be required if you are not already running Windows XP or Vista.
Windows 7 requirements for upgrade
In order to run Windows 7, your PC must have the following:

1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) processor
1 gigabyte (GB) RAM (32-bit) or 2GB RAM (64-bit)
16GB available hard disk space (32-bit) or 20GB (64-bit)
DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver
Additional System Requirements may be needed to run certain features.

Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor
Microsoft is providing a tool called the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor so customers can determine if their PCs are able to run Windows 7. It is a good idea to download the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor before upgrading. It will analyze your computer's processor, memory, storage, graphics capabilities, and any other compatibility issues. If possible, it will also provide guidance for resolving issues.

Please note that you should plug in and connect all USB devices, printers, and external hard drives when running the Upgrade Advisor. This will provide the best analysis of your system.

Windows Experience Index
The Windows Experience Index is another indicator of how well your computer will respond to Windows 7. The Windows Experience Index tests your system and rates it with a score of between 1 and 7.9. The higher the score, the better your computer's performance. Some Windows 7 features, like Aero, need a score of at least 3 to run.

To check your Windows Experience Index, click the Start Menu and select Computer. The Computer window will appear.
Select System Properties in the button bar at the top of the screen. The System Window displays your computer's Windows Experience Index rating. It also shows other system info, including whether your computer has a 32-bit or 64-bit processor.
Windows Experience Index Rating
Select the Windows Experience Index link to view the ratings of the individual computer components that are scored. The rating is determined by the lowest subscore.
Windows Experience Index Rating
In this case, a score of 4.3 should be sufficient to experience most of the new Windows 7 features. If your system scores lower than a 3, you may miss out on some of the digital media and graphics features, including Window's Aero.

What to consider before you upgrade
Once you have run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor and reviewed your system's Windows Experience Index, you will have a better idea of how Windows 7 will perform on your computer. Just to be sure, here are a few things to consider:

Do you have a 32-bit or 64-bit processor? The 64-bit processor can handle larger amounts of information and increase the responsiveness of the computer. Windows 7 can run on 32-bit and 64-bit computers, but some features may not perform as well on 32-bit computers.
Will you be upgrading from XP or Vista? Windows 7 was designed to be upgraded from Vista. If you are currently using the XP operating system, your upgrade experience may be complicated. You will have to back up your current files, programs, and settings and do a custom (clean) installation. Microsoft has subtly suggested that XP users should consider getting a new PC for Windows 7. If this is not an option and you are going to do a custom (clean) installation, you may want to get help from a computer service professional.
Are you interested in gaming, multimedia, and Windows Touch? With Windows 7, Microsoft improved graphics capabilities for gaming and the multimedia features of Windows Media Player. Additionally, Windows 7 has touch-screen capability. If these digital media features are important to you, make sure to review the Additional System Requirements before upgrading.
Windows Touch
Do you currently use Windows Mail or Outlook Express? Windows Mail and Outlook Express are not available on Windows 7. You will need to replace them with Windows Live Mail or another email program.
What kind of upgrade do you need?
If you are currently using Windows Vista, your upgrade experience should be easy. If you have XP, upgrading will likely be more complicated. Either way, it is probably best to download and run the Windows Upgrade Advisor before proceeding.

Based on the current version of your operating system, you will need to figure out if you have to perform a simple upgrade or a custom (clean) installation. You can visit Microsoft's Upgrade to Windows 7 page to determine which type of upgrade you need and what additional information should be considered before performing the upgrade.

Even if you do not need to do the custom (clean) installation, it is a good idea to back up your files before upgrading. For more information, read Protecting Your Computer in our Computer Basics tutorial.

Microsoft provides instructions for doing a custom (clean) installation. However, you may want to consider using a computer service professional if you are not comfortable with this process.

Windows versions
Once you have determined which Windows 7 version you want and what kind of upgrade you need to perform, you can go to a retail outlet or visit the Microsoft Store online to purchase your upgrade.

Conclusion
Now that you know what it takes to upgrade, you have a better idea of whether Windows 7 is right for you. Depending on your circumstances, upgrading may be an easy or complicated process. As previously mentioned, you should weigh any complications you may experience with your desire for the improvements and features Windows 7 has to offer. Time and cost are also factors, especially if you are considering purchasing a new computer.

  Windows 8 review: faster, simpler … and incredibly painful to use

With Windows 8.1 releasing to the masses it's important to get a handle on the functions the different "versions" of Windows 8.1 are intended to serve and the differences in features.

Windows 8.1 comes in three different versions: Basic Edition, Pro, and Enterprise.

 Basic Edition – Windows 8.1 Basic Edition (or just Windows 8.1) is intended for home users. This version includes the core features, but none of the business features. Basic Edition is great for those general consumers (mother, grandmother, father, step-uncle, far removed cousin).
 Pro – Windows 8.1 Pro is the operating system intended for small and medium-sized businesses. It provides abilities such as joining corporate domains, participating in Group Policy, allowing involvement in Work Place Join and Work Folders, encryption and more. You can find a good list of business features in the The IT Guide to Windows 8.1. Note that some of the new business features in Windows 8.1 Pro require a server running Windows Server 2012 R2 somewhere in the organization.
 Enterprise – Windows 8.1 Enterprise is the version that brings business premium features to Windows. Available through Windows Software Assurance, Windows 8.1 Enterprise includes all of the same features of Windows 8.1 Pro and then adds things like Windows To Go, DirectAccess, BranchCache, AppLocker, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), and Windows 8 app deployment.

    New Windows variant delivers on speed, security and simplicity – but its limited Windows Store apps and awful Edge browser just don’t cut it

Windows 10 S is the latest version of Microsoft’s new and improved operating system, which is about to launch with the new Surface Laptop and a series of machines from third-party manufactures.

It joins Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro as the three versions of Windows aimed at consumers. However, confusingly it is not an upgrade to either, but a class of Windows in and of itself.

What is it?
windows 10 S review

Strictly speaking Windows 10 S is Windows 10 Pro but with some limitations that are designed to, in Microsoft’s words, “be streamlined for simplicity, security and speed”. In other words Windows 10 S is meant to be more secure, faster and have longer battery life, like-for-like on the same computer.

The biggest limitation is that it is restricted to using only apps downloaded from the Windows Store, of which there are about 700,000 available. The quantity is not the issue, but the quality is: the Windows Store is full of dross, from outdated and abandoned apps, to clones and useless junk – but the situation is improving almost monthly.

How do I get it?
You can’t buy Windows 10 S without a machine: it will only come on new computers – primarily those aimed at the lower-end or the education market, aside from the Surface Laptop.

If I don’t like it can I change it?
Users can upgrade from 10 S to Windows 10 Pro with a few button presses, as Windows 10 S is built on Windows 10 Pro. For many the upgrade will be free for a limited amount of time. Surface Laptop users can upgrade to 10 Pro for free until the end of 2017 – or face a fee of around £50 after.

What’s it like to use?

Windows 10 S is the fastest version of Windows I have ever used – from switching and loading apps to booting up, it’s noticeably quicker than either Windows 10 Home or 10 Pro running on similar hardware.

If you only use the built-in Windows apps, such as Mail and Calendar, People, Skype, Edge and Office, Windows 10 S won’t seem any different – expect the speed. It behaves just like any other version of Windows 10. It has the normal Start menu and of course the same mix of new-looking Windows 10 interface hiding the ancient Windows XP-era Control Panel, if you dig deep enough. It’s not restricted in any noticeable day-to-day way (you can even mess with drivers, disks and group policy, just not the registry), apart from where you can install apps.

I found Windows Store restriction to be more bothersome than I expected. About half the apps I use on Windows come from the Store, which is great and makes setting up machines easier and faster. But the other half I find it very difficult to live without. For instance, I haven’t found a good simple text editor in the Windows Store – although there are many – and as I do not use Adobe I struggle to find an image-editing program that will do what I need.

Photoshop Elements 14 is available via the Windows Store, so if you were to stick with Windows 10 S that would be your best bet – but it’s no full Photoshop. Photoshop isn’t available on the Windows Store, and neither are excellent image editors such as Affinity Photo and the free Gimp.

I’m also a Spotify user, and as the desktop app isn’t available in the Windows Store, I was confined to the Flash-based Spotify Web player in Edge, which was a terrible experience (I quit after it failed to play more than two songs sequentially before falling over). I also missed the WhatsApp Windows 10 app, the Signal Chrome extension and Steam and all the games I have.

While I can get by with alternatives most of the time, one of the biggest issues I had with Windows 10 S was the limited browser selection – you’ve got Edge and that’s pretty much it unless you want to deal with Internet Explorer 11. You can’t install Chrome, Firefox, Opera or any other browser; they’re not available in the Windows Store and are highly unlikely to be – though given that Apple’s iTunes is coming to the Windows Store, never say never.

Edge
Windows 10 S review
Microsoft’s Edge browser is the worst thing about Windows 10 S. Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian
Microsoft’s Edge is an interesting problem. Some will like it – a more stripped-down experience of the web that you can draw all over. It has some nice features, but I found that it just wasn’t up to scratch as the only browser you have access to.

It’s faster than Chrome, Safari and all the rest – according to Microsoft – but I didn’t find it to be. It choked on some of the more mundane sites, requiring a couple of reloads to get it to render them correctly, and it wasn’t anything to do with plugins or Flash.

It failed to load Microsoft’s Office install subscription page, meaning I had to switch to another computer using Chrome to deactivate an older install of Office to activate it on another one. Not even being able to render your own site fully is a bit embarrassing.

Edge will struggle with anything built with Chrome or Firefox in mind. Trying to use the Guardian’s editorial tools was a nightmare of jumping text cursors, copy and paste garbage and straight-up broken features, all of which work perfectly fine in Chrome, Firefox and Safari.

The Wire browser messaging app didn’t work properly, missing certain characters from pasted text. Not even tech site Engadget’s galleries worked as they’re meant to.

Should all these sites and web apps work in Edge? Probably, but unless Windows 10 S becomes a storming success and grabs Edge a greater slice of the worldwide browser market share (it’s currently claiming just 1.73% compared to Chrome’s 54.14% according to data from StatCounter) then it’s unlikely everything will become compliant.

Observations
If you’re setting it up in anywhere quiet, plug in headphones before you start it up the first time as Cortana shouts at you
Most peripherals work fine, but if you need a particular utility to run your printer or scanner or any other peripheral, you can forget it
It comes with BitLocker to encrypt your hard drive
If you upgrade to Windows 10 Pro there’s no going back
I couldn’t find a way to paste plain text or to keep formatting in Edge
Edge was incredibly vexing
Verdict
Windows 10 S review

Windows 10 S is a nice attempt by Microsoft to create an easier to manage, faster Windows 10 experience. It feels like it is intended to become Microsoft’s default operating system – a step below Windows 10 Home – and that might be what happens unless consumers rebel.

It lives up to most of Microsoft’s promises. It is faster. It is more secure in that at least it won’t run anything that’s not downloaded from the Windows Store, and it is simpler. The underlying Windows 10 experience is great, so if all the normal applications people install were available through the Windows Store, it would be brilliant.

But they aren’t, and Edge simply isn’t ready to be your only browser – it is holding the whole of Windows 10 S back. The app situation may change, particularly if Windows 10 S becomes popular enough to be a draw for developers to get their programs into the Windows Store.

For now by all means try Windows 10 S, but be prepared to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro almost immediately.

 Windows 11 Is Faster than Windows 10 and Here’s Why
Posted on October 7, 2021 by Madalina Dinita 8 Comments

Many Windows 10 users are wondering if Windows 11 is indeed faster than its predecessor. That’s one key element that would convince many people to upgrade to the new OS version. Keep reading to find out more.


⇒ One quick note before we dive in. Do make sure your computer is compatible with Windows 11 before hitting the Update button. We’ve also got seven handy tips that you can use to ensure the upgrade process goes on smoothly.

Is Windows 11 Faster than Windows 10?
Personally, I’ve been using Windows 11 since the day Microsoft rolled it out to mainstream users. In terms of responsiveness, I can confirm that Windows 11 is indeed faster than Windows 10.

Apps Load Insanely Fast
When you click on an app icon, it loads instantly. The Windows 11 UI interface is definitely faster than Windows 10’s interface. Put a Windows 11 computer next to a Windows 10 machine, and you’ll quickly notice the difference.

Windows 11 has been great in terms of app stability and speed. So far, I haven’t experienced any issues with apps or programs freezing or crashing. I’ve never had to restart my computer because an app or the OS itself stopped responding.

Also, browser launching speed is significantly faster. This is valid for both Edge and third-party browsers. I initially thought there would be slight differences in speed between Edge and other browsers, but that’s not the case.

As a quick reminder, Edge now features sleeping tabs. You can use this option to put inactive tabs to sleep and save resources. By doing so, the OS can then direct those resources to foreground apps.

microsoft-edge-sleeping-tabs

The Secret Ingredient: A New Memory Management System
Windows 11 prioritizes apps and processes running in the foreground over background apps. Microsoft revamped the memory management system to favor foreground apps. In other words, the OS lets foreground apps use more CPU power and resources. Even if the CPU is under massive load, the UI feels responsive and fast thanks to foreground prioritization.

As a quick reminder, Windows 10 users often complain about apps using too much CPU power. Well, Windows 11 users will rarely encounter similar problems.

The same applies to Windows Shell, aka the OS graphical user interface. That’s why everything feels so fast and responsive. Moreover, the new memory management system also helps you extend your laptop’s battery life.

Games also start faster. However, I’m not referring to loading times here; that’s a whole different story that depends on many other factors. It’s just that you can launch games faster compared to previous OS releases.

Resume from Sleep Is Instantaneous
windows-11-sleep

My laptop now boots up and shuts down much faster. It also wakes from sleep much quicker compared to the Windows 10 era. Resuming from sleep is almost instantaneous. This is because Windows 11 features an optimized instant-on experience. Microsoft has optimized call to hardware components needed to power on.

At a software level, the company reduced starvation to key processing threads. In other words, while in Sleep mode, power is still preserved for the threads that really need it.

Another essential thing to note is that bloatware is still present but not running in the background. Fortunately, you can use PowerShell to remove bloatware.

Conclusion
Windows 11 definitely feels faster and smoother compared to Windows 10. Much of this comes from the improved memory management system that Windows 11 is using. If you own an average computer in terms of specs, you’ll definitely notice the difference. The same is valid for old low-specs machines. Windows 11 feels a lot snappier, even on HDD machines. Overall, it runs better than its predecessor on many computers.
